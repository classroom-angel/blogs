## Individual Accomplishments this Sprint

I did a lot of touch up on the API documentation, back-end, and front-end. I still need to protect the API to make it a fully viable application (it was unprotected previously for the convenience of front-end development with localhost).

## Detailed Analysis

[Pulls singular organization data](https://github.com/classroom-angel/labs11_prop_mngmt-FE/pull/233) is an interesting one since it involved using some of the specific org. data API routes that I wrote. Compartementalizing it all was a tad difficult at times; the repetition in the back-end code could be reduced with a few clever helper functions.

## Milestone Reflections

There has been a lot of trouble with styling due to the framework that we used; `!important` is used throughout its classes and makes the cascade quite annoying to try to tame.
