# Friday, April 19, 2019 - End of Week 5

## Individual Accomplishments this Sprint

For the second time this sprint, most of the work was styling. I made a lot of small contributions to the site. I have a Trello card with 13 linked pull requests. I went around the site looking for things to change and that needed to look or work better. My area has mostly been the landing page and payments page. 

## Detailed Analysis

Brian had asked that we make the Meet the Team page display our cards in random order. I figured this would be easy, it’s just a matter of changing the style of each card with a random order attribute. I made a function that would produce an array of randomly-generated numbers from 0 to 10 (exclusive). At first, I thought I called the function, but I had never invoked it, so that’s why the order hadn’t randomized at first. I got it working, and the cards show up in a random order!

## Weekly Reflection

We struggled a bit last week with the styling and that’s why we were told to repeat Week 4, the styling week. At the end of the week, Brian said it just needed a bit more touching up to look finished and that if we spend this weekend on it, we can avoid working another week next week. So our biggest problem was definitely coming to a consensus on styling. We stripped all of the color out of our application and started over. I have to say, it’s looking a lot more uniform and professional now.
